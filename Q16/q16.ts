// More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. 
// • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

// Original guest list
const guestList: string[] = ["Akram", "Aslam", "Akbar"];

// Print the guest who can't make it
const guestWhoCantMakeIt: string = guestList[1]; // Assuming the second person can't make it
console.log(`${guestWhoCantMakeIt} can't make it to the dinner.`);

// Replace the guest who can't make it with a new person
const newGuest: string = "Azhar";
guestList[1] = newGuest;

// Print a second set of invitation messages for the updated guest list
for (let i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Dear ${guestList[i]}, you are cordially invited to dinner. We would be honored to have your presence.`);
}

// Inform about the bigger dinner table
console.log("Good news! We found a bigger dinner table.");

// Add new guests using pop() and push()
guestList.push("Zafar"); // Add at the end using push()
guestList.splice(guestList.length / 2, 0, "Bilal"); // Add in the middle using splice()
guestList.push("Sana"); // Add at the end using push()

// Print new invitation messages for the updated guest list
for (let i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Dear ${guestList[i]}, you are cordially invited to dinner. We would be honored to have your presence.`);
}
